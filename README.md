**About:**

This project investigates historical sales data to uncover trends and patterns within a retail store's year-long performance. 
It will encompass a comprehensive analysis of sales figures across various product categories, identifying both the most popular items and the periods of peak sales activity throughout the year.

**Data Description:**

This dataset contains sales records for a retail store, spanning various timeframes throughout a year. The data originates from Maven Analytics and is structured across four tables.

**Content Summary:**

**Data Wrangling and Analysis**

The data wrangling process began with the creation of a relational database to house the dataset. Tables were designed to efficiently store the data and facilitate analysis. Data import procedures ensured data integrity by identifying and handling null values. Table joins were strategically employed to consolidate relevant data into a single table suitable for further analysis.

This wrangled data was then utilized to address the following business questions:

Product Variety: We identified distinct pizza types, distinct product names, and distinct product categories within the dataset.

Sales Performance: We determined the category with the largest revenue, total revenue generated by month, the size that sells the fastest, and the category that sells the fastest overall. Additionally, average quantity sold was calculated.

Granular Insights: We examined revenue by day, quantity sold by time of day (newly created table), and revenue by product name. Total revenue generated was also calculated.

Cost Analysis: A new table was created to incorporate the cost of goods sold (COGS) for further analysis (potentially profitability or margin calculations).

This approach ensured a clean, well-structured dataset that empowered the extraction of valuable insights into sales performance, product variety, and customer behavior.
